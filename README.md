### MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS

- Conceptualization
    - Define Requirements
    - Identify Variables 

- Exploratory Analysis (EDA)
    - Visualizing
    - Correlations
  
- Data Preparation
    - Removing Duplicates
    - Removing outliers
    - Handling missing values
      - Remove row
      - Imputing with average or median
      - Creating a model for predicting
    - Nonnormal Distributions
        -visualizations
        -qq plots
    - Kurtosis
      - log / root square scaling
    - Skewness
    
- Feature Selection
    - Remove features low variance
    - Forward selection
        - From an empty dataset, adds the feature that most improve the model
    - Backward elimination
        - Remove the least significant feature unitl the model performance degrades
    - Recursive feature elimination
        - Remove the least significant feature until a number of features is reached.

- Feature Engineering
    
- Model Selection
    - Based on Complexity
    - interpretability
    - Computational Resources
    - Customer Needs

- Training
    - HyperPareters
        - Grid Search
        - Random Search
        - Genetic Algoritm
        - Bayesian Search (e.g Optuna)
     
- Evaluation
    - Metrics for classification
        - Accuracy, F1
    - Metrics for regression
        - mae, mape, mase
